API Design open questions:
    
====================================================================================================================
== Feature support

- JTablet doesn't implement the notion of a physical tablet device. (TabletDevice refers to individual input 
  devices, such as a mouse or stylus.) 
  
  If we wanted to support whole tablet features like touch strips or tablet buttons, we would need some notion of 
  what tablets are connected and what features they support.
  
  Desired? Necessary?

- Currently JTablet2 implements multi-touch gesture support on Mac OS X. While this is nice, I feel the API may be 
  a little confusing in the context of a tablet API (especially since it never works outside of Mac OS X, and then, 
  even only on multitouch trackpads).
  
  While scrolling makes sense to a certain extend, should rotate, zoom and swipe be part of the core API or 
  separated out somehow?

- The whole factory deal� the intention is to add support for driver settings: e.g. ability to override the class 
  that is used to load the driver, affect behaviors about how events are generated, and set optional features.

====================================================================================================================
== Naming issues

- Naming for *Listener *Event *Device classes, possibilities (or some combination of the below):
  - Tablet: TabletListener, TabletEvent, TabletDevice 
     - pros: strong "brand" with JTablet name, usage is very clear
     - cons: technically it's not just tablet input, but can be used for mouse input,
        "TabletDevice" might refer to the entire tablet, not a specific stylus or input device
      
  - Cursor: CursorListener, CursorEvent, CursorDevice
     - pros: method names in the listener are already cursor* (i.e. cursorPressed, cursorReleased, etc.)
     - cons: not sure if cursor implies the right thing
  
  - Input: InputListener, InputEvent, InputDevice
     - pros: most abstract, 
     - cons: too abstract? InputEvent already exists in java.awt.event
     
- Naming for Support enum:
  - currently:
		Support.NONE		This feature is definitely not supported.
		Support.SUPPORTED	This feature is definitely supported.
		Support.UNKNOWN		It is unknown whether or not this feature is supported.
    - but NONE and SUPPORTED aren't parallel

== Alpha release todo

- decide how to deal with extension loading to avoid stepping on jpen's toes
  - (dynamically load jpen code in a separate jar?)
- write ant script to package everything up
- write ant script to install jtablet (or maybe just instructions for now?)
 - write java class installer?
- make applet test page
